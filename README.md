# A projectional DSL from the ground up

This repository contains the "fearless" prototypical implementation of a projectional DSL demoed during the following talks:

* A talk on April 1st 2019, as part of the PX/19 track of the Programming 2019 conference in Genua, Italy.
* A talk at the React Meetup Rotterdam, May 22nd 2019, hosted by Mendix.

The DSL is very simple: it deals with number literals, and binary expressions.
It's not quite feature complete, but it sufficed for the demo.
